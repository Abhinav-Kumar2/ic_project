You have achieved victory against the masterrmind who ruined your life. You take a deep breath, looking at the person with a mask laying down in a pool of blood.
You walk over to him, put a hand on his mask and remove it to uncover the identity of the murderer. However, nothing could prepare you for the shock that you would receive.
The person, the mastermind that made the past few days a living hell for you was your own blood, your son Jason!
You see your entire life go down in shatters as you can't believe the reality. As you are deeply engrossed in your thoughts, a sound recording starts around the room.
The sound recording is in the voice of your son, Jason. The recording starts with the voice being chock full of emotion as he explains evrything about why he did it.
Why he was angered by their lack of concern for him and his life, how he knew that he was wrong in thinking like this but he couldn't stop himself from being like this.
And all of it ends with an apology from him.
For some time, you couldn't understand the entirety of what had just happened right then but you remeber the positive  parts of your son and keep them in your memory while believing that even your wife would want to forgive their dear son.
You stand up and go outside the hidden door behind the cupboard and see a sunrise, reminding you of what all new things life has to offer.
