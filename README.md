## How to Build & Run

1. **Requirements:**
   - C compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, MSVC)
   - Windows OS (for some minigames using `<windows.h>` and `conio.h`)

2. **Build:**
   Compile each `.c` file as an executable. For example:
   ```sh
   gcc -o b24cm1018_b24cm1002_b24cm1053_b24cs1056_main.exe b24cm1018_b24cm1002_b24cm1053_b24cs1056_main.c
   ```
   Repeat for other minigames as needed.

3. **Run:**
   Start the main game:
   ```sh
   ./b24cm1018_b24cm1002_b24cm1053_b24cs1056_main.exe
   ```

   The main executable will call other minigame executables as you progress.
